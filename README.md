# Advent of Code 2023

My attempts solving the Advent Of Code challenge for 2023

My preferred language is Elixir, and I'll be making use of livebook to develop and test my implementations.

Elixir Benchmarks:

```
Name                  ips        average  deviation         median         99th %
day01.part1        1.25 K        0.80 ms     ±6.06%        0.80 ms        0.93 ms
day01.part2      0.0842 K       11.88 ms     ±9.64%       11.69 ms       21.71 ms
